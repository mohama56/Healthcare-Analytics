       ## Plot the 30-day mortality rates for heart attack

> outcome <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
> head(outcome)
       ## There are many columns in this dataset. You can see how many by typing ncol(outcome) (you can see
       ## the number of rows with the nrow function). In addition, you can see the names of each column by typing
       ## names(outcome) (the names are also in the PDF document).
    
       ##To make a simple histogram of the 30-day death rates from a heart attack 

> outcome[, 11] <- as.numeric(outcome[, 11])
> ## You may get a warning about NAs being introduced; that is okay
> hist(outcome[, 11])
