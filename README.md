U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Hospital Data


This project centers around analyzing the Hospital Compare Downloadable Database using RStudio,
a powerful platform known for its capabilities in statistical computing and data visualization. 
The database offers an extensive array of hospital performance metrics, including quality of care, 
patient safety, patient experience, and Medicare payment information. By examining these datasets, 
the project aims to identify trends, compare hospital performances, and evaluate outcomes related to patient care, 
such as mortality and readmission rates.

A crucial part of the analysis involves visualizing data using histograms to understand the distribution of key variables. 
For instance, histograms were likely used to display the spread of patient treatment numbers or the distribution of scores 
across different quality measures. This practice helps highlight the central tendency, variance, and potential outliers within 
the data, making complex information easier to digest and interpret.


The project also involves statistical analysis, using techniques to calculate averages, variances, and confidence intervals to 
assess hospital performance on critical indicators like 30-day mortality and readmission rates. These statistics offer a nuanced 
view of how hospitals measure up against national standards and peer institutions, aiding in identifying those that excel and those
that may need improvement.
